        <p class="lead mb-4">I have currently worked at Burger king as a server where I was able to gain excellent communication skills. I was able to help clean the store and close it and count the cash profits for the day. I have worked my way to shift lead where I was able to help guide my other team members and effectively run the store when managers were not present to help aid. I also handled any customer complaints and created a positive work environment for everyone. This has given excellent leadership and communication skills that I will use in the future for any career. I was also responsible for managing orders for food and ensuring we did not run out of anything we needed. Apart from inventory, I was also responsible for creating the shifts for the week and organizing the shifts to ensure everyone's requests for the next two weeks were met to the best of my ability. This job has definitely increased my professionalism and communication skills as well as my organizational skills managing this and school overall.
<br><br>

        I also worked at Target for about a year where I was able to assist customers and guide them to the items they needed. I handled the register and managed returns and any customer complaints the people were concerned about. I also managed restocking and anything of the sort that would help organize the store and keep everything clean for customers. I managed the IT department and handled any electronics that people needed or wanted to see overall. I helped assist other departments as well and went the extra mile to ensure everything was done on time. This job has definitely given me the professional experience to be able to handle multiple departments at a time. I would also be in charge of closing the store and ensuring everything was well organized before the doors closed and a new day started. This would help me overall in making sure I stayed organized every day.
<br><br>

I currently have had a position on board for a business organization on campus. I was a part of their marketing team. Here I was in charge of making professional flyers and would market the events on the website. I would collaborate with a team of 10 other board members to market the events they needed and wanted out of it. Whenever an event was coming out, I made the flyer and created a weekly agenda based on that experience. Once that was done, I was able to still navigate my classes and my job overall. It has helped me with my organization skills as well as my photoshop and canva skills that were needed to make the flyers and perform the job efficiently. At all the events, I was there to take pictures and market them on our social media platforms such as linkedin and instagram to increase our engagement by 10% overall. I also worked to help the other members in whatever tasks they needed overall.
